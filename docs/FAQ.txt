Q: Can I change the prompt type in specific sublevels?
A: Yes. Look at "effect:" in "retry_config/tables.asm".

Q: Can I change the prompt type in specific situations (not necessarily on a sublevel basis)?
A: Yes. Additionally to the "effect" table, there's the "!ram_prompt_override" address that, when set, will replace both the table and the default option (see "retry_config/ram.asm" and "docs/ram_map.txt"). For example, you could use it to let the player choose the prompt type as they want (you still have to implement that, though, as this only handles setting the prompt type).

Q: Can I keep the Retry prompt but remove the black box?
A: Yes. Look at "!no_prompt_box" in "retry_config/settings.asm".

Q: Can I keep the Retry prompt but remove the "exit" option?
A: Yes. Look at "!no_exit_option" in "retry_config/settings.asm". You can also remove it only under certain circumstances by setting "!ram_disable_exit" to 1 (for more info, see "retry_config/ram.asm" and "docs/ram_map.txt". For example, you can do it in a Level ASM init to make a level not have the option.

Q: Can I change where the prompt is shown on the screen?
A: Yes. Look at "!text_x_pos" and "!text_y_pos" in "retry_config/settings.asm". For example, using "!text_x_pos = $08" and "!text_y_pos = $D0" will place it on the lower left corner of the screen. Make sure to set "!no_prompt_box = 1", as the black box can't be move around easily.
