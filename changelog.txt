    - Fixed error on SA-1 that made respawning in midway entrances not work correctly.

    - Shrinked checkpoint and effect tables in half by having each value control 2 sublevels.
    - Changed !reset_rng define to a per-sublevel table to be able to have a different setting in each level (thanks Abdu for the suggestion).
