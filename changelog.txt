v0.1:
    - Initial version.

v0.1.1:
    - Added sprite initial facing fix.

v0.1.2:
    - Added compatibility with "Individual Dragon Coins Save" patch.
    - Added "load_title" routine in "retry_config/extra.asm".
    - Added "docs/sram_info.txt".

v0.1.3:
    - Fixed bug where the prompt options wouldn't appear when dying while the level end circle was active (thanks Sweetdude for finding this in the old retry patch).
    - Added !ram_prompt_override, that can be used to override the current level's prompt settings on the fly.
    - Added "docs/ram_map.txt".

v0.1.4:
    - Added !ram_disable_exit to remove the exit option on the fly (thanks Sweetdude and Abdu for the suggestion).

v0.1.5:
    - Added !ram_set_checkpoint to make Retry easily compatible with custom midway blocks/sprites.
    - Updated documentation.

v0.1.6:
    - Fixed room checkpoints respawning the player in the wrong sublevel sometimes (thanks FYRE150 for reporting this).
    - Fixed graphical glitches in some of the mode 7 vanilla bosses when the prompt was active.
    - Fixed error on SA-1 that made respawning in midway entrances not work correctly.
    - Fixed error where the midway bar for the current sublevel would respawn when leaving the current level, entering another one then going back to that sublevel (thanks FYRE150 for reporting this).
    - Added fix from original Retry involving secondary exits and "No Yoshi" intros.
    - Added way to reset the current level's checkpoint by setting a RAM address.

v0.1.7:
    - Changed the default SA-1 freeram address to avoid conflicts with lx5's DSS.
    - Fixed room checkpoints not working anymore.
    - Fixed rare start+select conflict with other patches.

v0.1.8:
    - Added identifier string in ROM with version number.
    - Renamed !freeram to !retry_freeram to avoid naming conflicts.
    - Split "gm14_end.asm" routines into multiple files inside the "code/hijacks/gm14_end" folder for more modularity.
    - Changed !reset_rng define to a per-sublevel table to be able to have a different setting in each level (thanks Abdu for the suggestion).
    - Fixed softlock when getting a checkpoint in the bonus game.
    - Optimized Retry RAM reset in "load_title.asm".
    - Fixed inconsistency with sprites movement with pipe entrances when respawning in a level (thanks LouisDoucet for reporting this).
    - Merged checkpoint and effect tables into a single checkpoint_effect table, where each digit corresponds to a value in the original tables. Besides keeping the most important sublevel options in a single place, it also saves 512 bytes of space.

v0.1.9:
    - Fixed issue where calling $00F606 in consecutive frames would trigger the death song even if disabled (thanks SuperMargot for reporting this).
    - Fixed issue where dying in a level with a "No Yoshi" entrance would respawn you in the wrong sublevel (thanks Abdu for reporting this).
    - Implemented death counter display.
    - Fixed Retry RAM reset loop only resetting the first byte (thanks BabaYegha and FYRE150 for reporting an odd issue caused by this).
    - Optimized the Retry RAM reset code even more.
    - Put Retry RAM reset code in gamemode 8 too. This fixes an issue where if people prevent the erase file menu to reload the title screen after erasing a file, the new save file would use the addresses saved to SRAM before the file was erased.
    - Removed code that reset the !ram_prompt_override and !ram_disable_exit addresses on overworld load.
    - Added !ram_prompt_x_pos and !ram_prompt_y_pos to change the prompt position at runtime.
