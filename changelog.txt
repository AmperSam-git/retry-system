v0.3.9:
    - Added fix (optional, enabled by default) for the weird vanilla behavior where levels 12E-13B are always forced to use the "No Yoshi Sign 2" intro regardless of their tileset (which can also mess up custom "No Yoshi Intro" patches).
    - Fixed !exit_animation = 0 or 1 behaving seemingly randomly, sometimes exiting immediately, sometimes after the prompt closed - now it will always exit when the prompt is closed (thanks to SJandCharlieTheCat for reporting this).
    - Fixed !exit_animation = 2 having incosistent timing when using different !prompt_freeze settings.
    - Fixed vanilla "high and low" tides timer not resetting when respawning, which would cause inconsistent tide behavior between retries.
    - Fixed vanilla layer 3 tides not stopping scrolling left when the Retry prompt is shown (only when using !prompt_freeze = 2).
    - Fixed Shell-less Koopas being able to move (fall) while the Retry prompt is shown (only when using !prompt_freeze = 2).

v0.3.8:
    - Made possible to use tiles in SP3/SP4 for the Retry prompt (just add $100 to the tile numbers in the settings).
    - Fixed camera position sometimes being inconsistent between loading a level normally and reloading it with Retry (thanks to schema_tuna for reporting and fixing this).
    - Optimized ram.asm (cleaner, faster compilation time).

v0.3.7:
    - Fixed collected invisible 1-UPs not resetting on death, which would allow to skip some of them after respawning (when not collecting them all).
    - Fixed scroll sprites speeds not resetting on death (thanks to LouisDoucet for reporting this).
    - Small refactor of addresses reset code on death.
    - Added fix (optional, enabled by default) for the bug where Mario's lives don't cap at 99 when the status bar is nuked (this usually causes the Overworld to display a glitched amount and makes Mario have a halo).
    - Fixed issue where if a level is placed on the very left edge of the Overworld (beneath where the vanilla border is), then Retry would respawn you in level 0 when dying in that level (thanks to LouisDoucet for reporting this).
    - Added compatibility with the "Level Depending on Event" and "Level Depending on Ram Address" patches: now Retry respawning and checkpoints will work correctly when in the new levels! (as an added bonus, it adds midway support to those patches, since they don't quite work originally).
    - Actually fixed the intro level bug from v0.3.4, which also fixes the mosaic effect not appearing when respawning in it.

v0.3.6:
    - Made so the Retry prompt shows up immediately when falling in a pit and not using !fast_prompt = 1.
    - Fixed cursor and letters outlines when not using the prompt box (now they're the same as in GFX28).
    - Added !disable_hurry_up option to disable the tempo hike effect when reaching 100 seconds in a level.
    - Added !pipe_entrance_freeze option to force lock/unlock sprites during pipe entrances and avoid possible inconsistencies of the vanilla method (default is vanilla for consistency with previous versions).
    - Added !ram_midways_override address that can be used to override midways (prevent midways from spawning and/or prevent room checkpoints to work). Inspired by the "No midways" mode in the hack "Sure Shot".
    - Added "door_animation" extra routine that will be called every frame during the fadeout when entering a door.
    - Fixed being able to use Start+Select in the intro level due to Retry's custom Start+Select behavior.

v0.3.5:
    - Fixed insertion issue in case another UberASM code uses nested namespaces, for example Dynamic Z (thanks to Alex for reporting this).
    - Added label definition for each Retry freeram define so that they can be referenced by other UberASM codes without having to copy-paste the defines in the other files.
    - - Added setting (turned on by default) for Boo Ring's position reset on death and/or on level load, useful for consistency in Kaizo levels.
    - Added optional fix for some animations still running when the Retry prompt is shown (like Magikoopa's Magic flashing), with the !prompt_freeze = 2 setting.
    - Fixed timer still ticking down while the Retry prompt is shown when using !prompt_freeze = 0.
    - Added optional fix for being able to drop the reserve item while Mario is dying or the Retry prompt is shown.
    - Added compatibility with MarioFanGamer's "Inline Layer 3 Messages" patch (no need to use !retry = 1 in the patch).
    - Added !prompt_wave and !prompt_wave_speed options to make the letters in the currently selected prompt option wave up and down.

v0.3.4:
    - Fixed issue where using $0DAA-$0DAD to disable pressing select wouldn't stop Retry from exiting the level when holding the select button.
    - Better handling of the !fast_prompt option in the code.
    - Restored Retry patch feature where pressing A/B during the death animation makes the prompt show immediately (when not using !fast_prompt == 1).
    - Fixed issue where dying in the intro level and retrying would send you to level 0 (thanks to Selicre for reporting this).
    - Added !prompt_freeze setting to allow to keep sprites and animations running while the Retry prompt is shown.
    - Added !exit_animation setting to allow to skip the death animation when using the "Exit" prompt option.

v0.3.3:
    - Fixed issue where the saved data wouldn't get reloaded after going to the game over screen, which could cause, for example, unsaved checkpoints to be retained after getting a game over (thanks to simon.caio for reporting this).
    - Added new section to the "save" and "sram_defaults" table to put addresses that won't be reloaded from SRAM when getting a game over, and added a "!save_after_game_over" setting to save the game after a game over. Both of these options together can help having some addresses that don't get reloaded from SRAM when getting a game over (if you want the player to retain them even if they didn't get the chance to save the game, for example individual Dragon Coins or the death counter), and ensuring that they actually get saved to SRAM right after (thanks to simon.caio for the idea).
    - Added a "game_over" routine in "extra.asm" that is called during the game over screen, which could be useful to initialize/save some addresses when getting a game over.
    - Fixed issue with the "Time Up Fix" patch where dying due to a timeout would prevent the timer from working after respawning (thanks to worldpeace for reporting this).
    - Small optimization in Death Prelude SFX.
    - Fixed inconsistent sprite freezing at level start when using a pipe entrance in a level's main sublevel (thanks to BabaYegha for reporting this).
    - Fixed issue where, if going through a pipe during the goal walk, getting a midway and dying afterwards, the music wouldn't restart playing when respawning (thanks to LouisDoucet for reporting this).
    - Fixed issue where using resources that reset $71 after Mario dies (e.g. revive blocks) would cause Mario to be stuck in his death pose and animations to stay frozen (thanks to SJandCharlieTheCat for reporting this).

v0.3.2:
    - Made the death counter cap at 99999 deaths, instead of overflowing back to 0.
    - Fixed silent room checkpoint SFX sometimes not playing.
    - Moved "retry.asm" in a "library" folder for consistency.
    - Added "level_end_frame.asm" to run level-specific routines at the end of each GM14 frame.

v0.3.1:
    - Made the oscillating cursor option work with the black box enabled.
    - Added an optional button that can trigger the "Exit" prompt function even if the exit option is disabled (thanks to Mega for the suggestion).
    - Fixed the green star block coin counter not resetting when dying (thanks to Koopster for reporting this).

v0.3.0:
    - Optimized the drawing routine to use as few OAM slots as possible (min 6, max 15) depending on the current box and exit disable settings. Before, it was always either 11 or 15.
    - Now the cursor actually uses the !cursor_palette (before it used !letter_palette).
    - Allow for ObjecTool custom normal objects $42-$4F along with $52-$FF, since they're never used for the custom midways (thanks to MarioFanGamer for suggesting this).
    - Added new cursor options (static, blinking, oscillating).
    - Fixed an issue with the sprite initial facing fix that sometimes caused Yoshi to run away in the wrong direction when hit by a sprite while riding him (thanks to Abdu for reporting this).
    - Fixed an issue where dying on the same frame Baby Yoshi started the growing animation would cause sprites and animation to not be frozen while the prompt is shown (thanks to LouisDoucet for reporting this).
    - Fixed an issue where dying on the same frame Yoshi started eating a berry (and maybe a normal sprite too) it would cause the game to hardlock.

v0.2.7:
    - Fixed an issue where sprites would disappear when the Retry prompt was active, in case the end of the OAM table was filled (thanks to LouisDoucet for reporting this).
    - Changed ordering on this document to list more recent versions before older ones.

v0.2.6:
    - Changed !lose_lives define to a table to enable/disable infinite lives on a sublevel basis.
    - Fixed issue where sometimes Mario would die or have weird interactions on the first frame after respawning in a layer 2 level (thanks to FYRE150 for reporting this).
    - Finished "extra.asm" routines documentation.

v0.2.5:
    - Added more support for ObjecTool, by only reserving Custom Normal Objects 00-51 for the custom midway bar, allowing to use Custom Normal Objects 52-FF in ObjecTool normally.
    - Added ObjecTool readme.

v0.2.4:
    - Fixed issue that would prevent the Game Over music from playing when running out of lives (with !lose_lives = 1) and play the death SFX during the Game Over screen (thanks to simon.caio for reporting this).
    - Fixed game crash when using the VWF Dialogues patch, due to Retry overwriting the SRAM size even when it was set to a larger size by an external resource (thanks to simon.caio for reporting this).
    - Made some space and cycle optimizations to the NMI routine.

v0.2.3:
    - Fixed issue with ROMs where Lunar Magic v3.0+ was used but the routine at $03BCDC wasn't installed (thanks to SJandCharlieTheCat for reporting this).
    - Change get_screen_number macro to a subroutine and made it check for LM3's $03BCDC routine installation at runtime, for more robustness.
    - Changed settings.asm formatting to be a bit easier to use.
    - Small speed improvement for SRAM saving/loading on FastROM.

v0.2.2:
    - Added an option to replace "Mario" with "DEATHS" in the status bar, like the standalone Death Counter patch.
    - Optimized sprite load index table reset loop.
    - Fixed issue where calling $00F606 in consecutive frames could make the level's music restart even if it didn't change (similar fix to v0.1.9).

v0.2.1:
    - Fixed issue where choosing an option in the Retry prompt wouldn't play the sound effect.

v0.2.0:
    - Fixed issue with the Retry prompt not appearing when !no_prompt_box = 1 and setting !ram_disable_box to #$00.
    - Added SRAM initialization code for new save files and added "load_new_file" extra routine.

v0.1.9:
    - Fixed issue where calling $00F606 in consecutive frames would trigger the death song even if disabled (thanks SuperMargot for reporting this).
    - Fixed issue where dying in a level with a "No Yoshi" entrance would respawn you in the wrong sublevel (thanks Abdu for reporting this).
    - Implemented death counter display.
    - Fixed Retry RAM reset loop only resetting the first byte (thanks BabaYegha and FYRE150 for reporting an odd issue caused by this).
    - Optimized the Retry RAM reset code even more.
    - Put Retry RAM reset code in gamemode 8 too. This fixes an issue where if people prevent the erase file menu to reload the title screen after erasing a file, the new save file would use the addresses saved to SRAM before the file was erased.
    - Removed code to reset the !ram_prompt_override and !ram_disable_exit addresses on overworld load.
    - Added !ram_prompt_x_pos and !ram_prompt_y_pos to change the prompt position at runtime.
    - Added !ram_disable_box to be able to enable/disable the Retry prompt box at runtime. A bunch of code in nmi.asm, prompt_oam.asm and prompt.asm was rewritten to account for this.

v0.1.8:
    - Added identifier string in ROM with version number.
    - Renamed !freeram to !retry_freeram to avoid naming conflicts.
    - Split "gm14_end.asm" routines into multiple files inside the "code/hijacks/gm14_end" folder for more modularity.
    - Changed !reset_rng define to a per-sublevel table to be able to have a different setting in each level (thanks Abdu for the suggestion).
    - Fixed softlock when getting a checkpoint in the bonus game.
    - Optimized Retry RAM reset in "load_title.asm".
    - Fixed inconsistency with sprites movement with pipe entrances when respawning in a level (thanks LouisDoucet for reporting this).
    - Merged checkpoint and effect tables into a single checkpoint_effect table, where each digit corresponds to a value in the original tables. Besides keeping the most important sublevel options in a single place, it also saves 512 bytes of space.

v0.1.7:
    - Changed the default SA-1 freeram address to avoid conflicts with lx5's DSS.
    - Fixed room checkpoints not working anymore.
    - Fixed rare start+select conflict with other patches.

v0.1.6:
    - Fixed room checkpoints respawning the player in the wrong sublevel sometimes (thanks FYRE150 for reporting this).
    - Fixed graphical glitches in some of the mode 7 vanilla bosses when the prompt was active.
    - Fixed error on SA-1 that made respawning in midway entrances not work correctly.
    - Fixed error where the midway bar for the current sublevel would respawn when leaving the current level, entering another one then going back to that sublevel (thanks FYRE150 for reporting this).
    - Added fix from original Retry involving secondary exits and "No Yoshi" intros.
    - Added way to reset the current level's checkpoint by setting a RAM address.

v0.1.5:
    - Added !ram_set_checkpoint to make Retry easily compatible with custom midway blocks/sprites.
    - Updated documentation.

v0.1.4:
    - Added !ram_disable_exit to remove the exit option on the fly (thanks Sweetdude and Abdu for the suggestion).

v0.1.3:
    - Fixed bug where the prompt options wouldn't appear when dying while the level end circle was active (thanks Sweetdude for finding this in the old retry patch).
    - Added !ram_prompt_override, that can be used to override the current level's prompt settings on the fly.
    - Added "docs/ram_map.txt".

v0.1.2:
    - Added compatibility with "Individual Dragon Coins Save" patch.
    - Added "load_title" routine in "retry_config/extra.asm".
    - Added "docs/sram_info.txt".

v0.1.1:
    - Added sprite initial facing fix.

v0.1.0:
    - Initial version.
